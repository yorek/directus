# Fields

> Fields are a specific type of value within a Collection, storing the data of your item's content. Each field represents a **column** in your database. [Learn more about Fields](/concepts/fields/).

## Creating a Field

1. Navigate to **Settings > Data Model > [Collection Name]**
2. Under Fields & Layout, click the **Create Field** button
3. **Choose the field type**, and follow its specific setup guide...

- [Presentation Field](/guides/field-types/presentation-field)
- [Many-to-One Field](/guides/field-types/many-to-one-field)

::: tip System Fields

While all out-of-the-box system fields are locked from editing or deleting, you are able to create new fields within the system collections. You can enable editing System Collections within the Collection sidebar component of [Settings > Data Model](/concepts/databases/).

::: tip Database Fields

Keep in mind that a Directus Field is just a database column. Therefore you can import or create a column directly in
the database, and it will automatically appear within Directus. The first time you manage that column, a
`directus_fields` record will be created with default values.
