## Storing Sensitive Extension Variables

If your extension requires storing sensitive data, such as an API Key, you can store that information in
[custom environment variables](#). This data can then be accessed globally by server-side extensions (eg: custom hooks
or endpoints). If you need access to that private data on the client-side (eg: custom interfaces or displays), then you
would expose that env variable via a custom endpoint with proper limitations.
